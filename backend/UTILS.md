What are utils file?

In programming, a "utils" file typically refers to a file or module containing utility functions or helper functions. These functions are generally small, reusable pieces of code that perform common tasks or operations.

The purpose of organizing utility functions into a separate file or module is to promote code reusability and maintainability. Instead of duplicating code across different parts of a program, developers can centralize common functionality in a utils file and then import and use those functions wherever needed.

Common examples of utility functions found in a utils file might include functions for:

    String manipulation
    Date and time formatting
    File I/O operations
    Mathematical calculations
    Error handling
    Data validation

By keeping these functions separate from the main logic of the program, developers can keep their codebase clean and modular, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
